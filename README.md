# alarm_view
Web application for viewing alarm controller simulations for Bucknell's CSCI320.

See: https://www.eg.bucknell.edu/~csci320/project-1-verilog-warm-up/

### Trace format

The input files are line-based text files. Each line uses a fixed width format as shown below (more examples are in the **examples** folder).
```
              BUZZER
             ---------\
                       \
               ALARM   |
            ---------\ |
                     | |
           timestamp | |    Led1    Led2    Led3    Led4
|-------- 21 ------| | | |--7--| |--7--| |--7--| |--7--|
                   0 0 0 0000000 0000000 0000000 0000000
```

There is no format verificaiton and malformatted files will certainly crash the server.

### Notes to run on Bucknell's Lab Machines

This application requires Flask to be installed. On the Bucknell machines, currently Flask is installed for Python 2.7 and Python 3.4. Either will work, but neither is the current default python interpreter.

To use python 2.7:
```
$ python2.7 showclock.py
```

To use python3.4:
```
$ source /usr/remote/python-3.4/setup.sh
$ python showclock.py
```

### Running

Once you run `showclock.py` you should see the line below when the server starts.
```
INFO:werkzeug: * Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/
```

To access the web interface, just point your web browser to http://localhost:5000/ (or insert the name of the machine running the server). You should see a page similar to the one below.

This is generated by listing all of the files in the `FILE_PATH`, it defaults to `./examples`. You can modify `showclock.py` to use whatever path your want.

Clicking on a filename will load the visualization with the first line of the file. If the file is not a valid the server will likely crash.

At the top the current file, line, timestamp, alarm state, and buzzer state is shown. Below that is a rendering of the 7-segment display. All 127 possible digits have been generated by the `makedigits.py` script. Feel free to contribute a fancier set of digits.

Below the display are navigation icons. The house takes you back to the list of output files. The left and right arrows move to the previous/next timestep respectively. Moving to an arbitrary line is possible by modifying the url directly. The format is: `http://localhost:5000/show/<filename>/<line_number>`.
